**Real-Time Emotion Detection Using AI**

This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using a webcam feed. It uses OpenCV for face detection and DeepFace for emotion recognition, capable of identifying emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more.

**Features**
Real-time emotion detection via webcam

Emotion classification using pre-trained deep learning models

Visual display of detected emotions on live video

Recognizes emotions like happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear, disgust, and neutral

**Tech Stack**

Programming Language: Python
**Libraries Used:**OpenCV,DeepFace,NumPy
Model: DeepFaceâ€™s built-in pre-trained models
Face Detection: Haarcascade frontal face classifier

**Requirements**

Python 3.x
OpenCV
DeepFace
NumPy

**Future Enhancements**

Save emotion detection history
Store emotion data in a database
Add a graphical interface using Streamlit
Support for multiple faces with tracking
