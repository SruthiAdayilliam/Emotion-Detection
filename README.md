Real-Time Emotion Detection Using AI
This project implements a real-time emotion detection system using a webcam feed. By combining OpenCV for face detection and DeepFace for emotion recognition, it can classify emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, and more.

Features
Real-time emotion detection via webcam.
Deep learning-based emotion classification using DeepFace.
Live visualization of predicted emotions on screen.
Supports multiple emotions including happy, sad, angry, surprise, fear and neutral.

Tech Stack
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
OpenCV
